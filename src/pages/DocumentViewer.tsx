    <p>WHEREAS, the Employee desires to be employed by the Company on such terms and conditions.</p>
    <h3>1. TERM OF EMPLOYMENT</h3>
    <p>1.1 The term of employment under this Agreement (the "Employment Term") shall commence on the Effective Date and continue thereafter for a period of three (3) years, unless earlier terminated in accordance with Section 4 hereof. The Employment Term shall automatically renew for successive one (1) year periods unless either party provides written notice of non-renewal at least sixty (60) days prior to the end of the then-current Employment Term.</p>
    <h3>2. POSITION AND DUTIES</h3>
    <p>2.1 Position. During the Employment Term, the Employee shall serve as the Chief Technology Officer of the Company, reporting directly to the Chief Executive Officer. The Employee shall have such duties, authority, and responsibility as are commensurate with such position and as may be assigned to the Employee by the Chief Executive Officer or the Board of Directors of the Company (the "Board").</p>
    <p>2.2 Duties. During the Employment Term, the Employee shall devote substantially all of his business time and attention to the performance of the Employee's duties hereunder and will not engage in any other business, profession, or occupation for compensation or otherwise which would conflict or interfere with the performance of such services either directly or indirectly without the prior written consent of the Board.</p>
    <h3>3. COMPENSATION AND BENEFITS</h3>
    <p>3.1 Base Salary. During the Employment Term, the Company shall pay the Employee a base salary at the annual rate of $225,000, payable in accordance with the Company's customary payroll practices.
